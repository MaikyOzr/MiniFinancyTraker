# miniFinancyTraker

I'm ending the challenge because I won't have time to fix the bugs and add the functionality.

SECURITY

is the only thing I won't manage to add.

I've noticed two issues in my program, but due to time constraints, I won't be able to fix them.

I did this exercise just to prove to myself that I'm not studying programming in vain (I wasn't seeing any progress)
